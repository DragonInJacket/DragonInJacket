- 👋 Hi, I’m @DragonInJacket (soon M.Sc, maybe Ph.D. one year 🎓).
- 🥼 I'm a budding scientist in the field of chronic pain. I'm interested in the interaction between pain, physical activity and behaviours.
- 👀 I’m interested in music, video games, sports. I also quite enjoy cooking even though I repeatedly prepare the same dish (if only it wasn't for my lazyness to look up new recipees).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R (apparently I've become quite good at it in the past year!).
